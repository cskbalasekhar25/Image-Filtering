# Image-Filtering
Image filtering operation in C++

The main.cpp contains the necessary code for filtering of the image. The filtering process is dependent on the custom PIXEL class
which has its own user defined header file and constructors. All the function definitions of the UDF are defined in seperate .cpp files for 
better readability and needs to be attched to the project before running the file.
